# FCC-Universe-DB

## What is this project and why are we doing it?

First time creating a database using PostgreSQL. Things I learned and practiced from the CLI:
- connecting to database
- listing databases, displaying tables in db, and display table structure
- Viewing data
- Joining tables
- Creating DBs and tables
- Inserting rows
- Adding primary/foreign keys
- Junction tables
- Composite primary keys

## Expected Outcomes

Create a small time database of different types of bodies in the universe while getting better at using databases by themselves.
